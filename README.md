FinalProject
============
This is our group's final project in the course Interactive Programming at KTH during Feb - Apr 2014. The requirement was to make an interative prototype of web pages. 

In our project, we developed an idea called PoppiBook which is to let parents to create customised story books for their children using this online platform. The final prototype contains 4 parts (pages):
1) a landing page to introduce the product
2) a story book builder which let users to create story pages, drag-and-drop graphics and add text to the pages
3) a preview page to let users to preview the story book
4) an order page to place an order for the story book

This web app is an one-page application adopting Model-View-Controller architecture using jQuery, jQuery UI and Bootstrap CSS.
